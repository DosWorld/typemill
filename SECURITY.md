# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We only support the latest version of Typemill (1.5.3.4). We will drop the support of Typemill Version 1.X as soon as a stable version of Typemill Version 2.X is released.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any vulnerabilities you found to security@typemill.net. Please publish the vulnerability to the public only after we informed you about a fixed version.

* Vulnerabilities with high risks will be fixed in a hotfix release quickly and we will report them in a ticket and in a newsletter asap. 
* Vulnerabilities with low risks will be fixed in the normal release workflow, which is between 2 and 4 weeks.

Thank you very much to help us keeping Typemill as secure as possible!
