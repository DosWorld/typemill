## Installation

Download TYPEMILL from the [TYPEMILL website](http://typemill.net), unzip the files and you are done.

If you are a developer, you can also clone this repository. To do so, open your git command line (e.g. gitbash), go to your project folder (e.g. htdocs) and type:

    git clone git://github.com/trendschau/typemill.git

The GitHub-version has no vendor-folder, so you have to update and include all libraries and dependencies with composer. To do so, open your command line, go to your TYPEMILL folder and type:

    composer update

If you did not use composer before, please go to the [composer website](http://getcomposer.org) and start to learn.

To run TYPEMILL on a **live** system, simply upload the files to your server

## Make Folders Writable.
