# Use Cases

Whenever you want to publish a finished text work as a website and if you like writing with Markdown, then TYPEMILL is a smart and lightweight solution. Possible use cases are â€¦

- a documentation
- a manual
- a user guide
- a whitepaper
- a handbook
- a tutorial
- a study
- a book
- a drama
- a lyric collection
- a collection of articles

If you want to create a blog, a wiki or a classic corporate website, please use a specialized CMS for that instead of TYPEMILL.

TYPEMILL is under heavy developement and not finished right now. It has an admin panel for settings and a basic editor for existing content. More options like create new pages and manage your media-files will be added step by step in the next weeks. Also different output formats like mobi and ePup are on the roadmap, so stay tuned.

For now, you have to use a FTP-software like FileZilla until all basic editing features are ready. Check the roadmap for more informations.
