# Folder Structure

You can create any kind of folder structure with TYPEMILL, as long as you follow the naming conventions for folders and files.

However, if you create a very deep structure, then it might result in an odd design or even in usability errors. Similar to real live, it is always a good idea to keep the hierarchy as flat as possible.
