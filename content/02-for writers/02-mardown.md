# Markdown

Never heard of Markdown? Markdown is a simple syntax for text formatting and very similar to the markup used by wikipedia. Markdown uses a handful special characters like `#` of `*` to format the text. 

The big advantage for writers: They don't have to click a button to format a headline or to create a list. Instead they can format the text during the writing process without an interruption. Once you are familiar with the syntax, you can write cleaner and faster than with any common HTML editor. For a quick start with many examples, read the [markdown reference page](/info/markdown-test).

## Markdown Example

This is a short example for a markdown text: 

````
# My first level headline

This is a paragraph and now we create an unordered list:

- Item
- Another item
- A last item
````

From a technical point of view, markdown is cleaner, shorter and safer than HTML. At the same time, markdown can be transformed to clean HTML easily. This is why markdown is used by a lot of technology platforms like GitHub or StackOverflow. And Markdown is also entering the non technical mainstream. The press releases of dpa are written in Markdown, for example.
