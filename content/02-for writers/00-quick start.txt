["# Quick Start for Writers","You are a pro and don't want to read the whole manual? No problem, this is a quick overview:","- **Setup**: Login to your system and setup the system, the themes and the plugins in the author panel.\n- **Content**: Organize your content in folders and markdown files and put them in the `\\content` folder of TYPEMILL. \n- **Markdown**: Use the Markdown syntax for your content files. Markdown Extra (e.g. tables, footnotes) is supported, too.\n- **Naming conventions**: Use prefixes like `01-` or `aa_` to sort your folders and files.\n- **Index files**: Add an `index.md` file to a folder to create content for the folder itself.\n- **F5**: After some changes, use the `F5` key to refresh the navigation manually.\n- **Lean back** and let TYPEMILL create a nice website for you.","\nThe TYPEMILL system ships with this user manual in the content folder.
