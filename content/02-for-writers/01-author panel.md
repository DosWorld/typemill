# The Author Panel

You can login to the author panel with this url:

````
https://yourwebsite.net/tm/login
````

You can also use the url `https://yourwebsite.net/setup` that redirects to the login screen.

## The Content Editor

In the **content area** of the author panel you can:

* Navigate through your existing content.
* Create new pages.
* Edit existing pages with markdown syntax.
* Re-order existing pages with simple drag&drop.
* Save drafts, publish pages, unpublish pages and delete pages.

There are several **limitations** right now:

* You cannot use HTML, JavaScript or any other code in the editor, only markdown-syntax is allowed.
* There is no media-management right now.

The content editor has highest priority in the roadmap, so you can expect a lot of improvements in the next weeks.

## Settings, Themes and Plugins

In the **settings area** of the author panel you can:

* Configure your **system**.
* Choose and configure a **theme**.
* Activate and configure **plugins**.
* Manage **users**.
