# Plugins

As of version 1.1.0, TYPEMILL supports plugins. You can activate and configure all plugins in the author panel of TYPEMILL. You will see a small update banner if there exists a new version of the plugin.

To update a plugin, simply go to the plugin folder of TYPEMILL, delete the plugin and upload the new version of the plugin. Then check the plugin configuration in the settings of the author panel. 

Right now all plugins are delivered with the core version of TYPEMILL. But as the number of plugins grows, there will probably be a central place to download and install the plugins in the future.

The core version ships with the following plugins:

* **Cookie Consent**: Adds a cookie consent banner to your website. 
* **Analytics**: Adds Matomo (Piwik) or Google Analytics to your website.
* **Highlight**: Highlights code in code-blocks (useful for developers).
* **Math**: Write math with markdown and MathJax or KaTeX. Check the [markdown reference page](/info/markdown-test).

If you are a developer and if you want to create your own plugins, please refer to the [plugin documentation](/plugin-developers).
