# Content Elements

Cyanine provides a lot of other settings for your content area. For example: 

[ebook (EPUB, 496.65 KB)](media/files/ebook.epub){.tm-download file-epub}

The Cyanine theme supports all content elements like tables, images, notices or downloads. It also supports anchor-links next to headlines, so you can deep link to certain content sections of your page. You can activate the anchors in the system settings of Typemill.
